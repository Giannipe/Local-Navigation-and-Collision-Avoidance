# Local-Navigation-and-Collision-Avoidance
An autonomous navigation system was developed to let a robot follow a moving target while avoiding obstacles. By combining LiDAR sensing, visual tracking with AprilTags, and the DWA algorithm, the robot achieved reliable results in both simulation and real-world experiments.
